# Levels 101
Concept: Explain the Foundry VTT Levels module with visual aids.

It started as an infographic but I decided to try my hand at converting it to a site. Both are me trying to develop graphic design + front-end skills.
There's a few things I feel like I could've done better in terms of visual hierarchy, organization, and generally the code itself, but I feel like I learned quite a bit from it.

The images I used for the backdrops etc. were licenced and paid for via Envato Elements. I will not be uploading the assets I do not own or did not create myself.
