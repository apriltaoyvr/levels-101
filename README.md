# Levels 101
**Concept**: Explain the Foundry VTT Levels module with visual aids.

Side project for learning graphic design + CSS/HTML. It started as just the infographic but decided to give converting it to a page as a shot.

There's a few things I feel like I could've done better in terms of visual hierarchy, organization, and generally the code itself, but I feel like I learned quite a bit from it.

The images I used for the backdrops etc. were licenced and paid for via Envato Elements. I will not be uploading the assets I do not own or did not create myself.
